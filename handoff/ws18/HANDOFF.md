# WS-18 Revisions handoff

The WS-02 thread has owned this since 2026-10-15. The integration lead
assigned it once WS-02's queue was empty, under Tadjiro's standing
instruction of 2026-10-14 21:24 UTC to keep building toward the roadmap.
The crate is `novo-revisions`. It is already listed in
`[workspace.dependencies]`, but its directory doesn't exist yet.

## Plan
1. DESIGN PR. Adds §7 "Revisions" (what a revision is, how it ties to
   page freeze, what Changes compares), a §8 row "Checkpoints: revisions
   only", and a §10 model addition. Reviewers: the main reviewer and the
   design reviewer.
2. novo-core (WS-02): a `Revision` record (index, date, author,
   description) and a command to make one.
3. novo-storage (WS-04, to ask): a snapshot table keyed by revision id.
4. novo-revisions:
   - the index rule and the next index;
   - issuing a revision, which writes the record and freezes every
     schematic page;
   - listing revisions;
   - diffing two projects into a per-page change set;
   - the title block fields (project revision, page revision, revision
     table).

## State
- 2026-10-15: DESIGN PR opened.
