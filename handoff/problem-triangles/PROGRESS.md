2026-11-04 08:50 UTC design doc written (docs/design/problem-triangles.md), 16 lanes planned

## 2026-11-04 Lane T0a (novo-flags model and store)
- `novo-flags` now holds `Flag`, `FlagDraft`, `Anchor` (string ids, so no novo-core dependency), `Severity`, `map_word`, `FlagId` (FNV-1a of source, rule, sorted anchors) and `FlagStore` (`replace_source`, `set`/`clear`, waivers by id and by Issues key, `take_fresh` for the pulse, `at`, `roll_up`, `roll_up_where`, `next` for F8, `by_area`, `counts`). 12 tests.
- Adapters in novo-app (lane T0b) build `FlagDraft`s; drawing, popover, Flags list and top bar pill are T0b, not here.

## 2026-11-04 Lane T0b (schematic migrated)
- `novo-canvas`: `MarkKind::Warning` (yellow hollow), `Error` (red solid, the octagon is gone), new `Unchecked` (dashed yellow); glyph 14 pt; `Mark.key` carries the flag id.
- `novo-editor`: `EditorView::take_mark_click()` hands back the keys of the marks under a primary click.
- `novo-theme`: `widgets::flag_triangle` (painted glyph), Issues pill draws triangles.
- `novo-app` `app/flags.rs`: `draft(&Problem)` -> `FlagDraft` for all 76 kinds (Info is no flag; DepthUnknown, GuessedWire, UnsizedDuct dashed), `FlagUi` in `wb.flags` filled from `wb.problems` by revision, `flag_marks` (replaces the old marks), `flag_popover` (title, badge, detail, Locate / Fix / Waive / Explain / Copy; Esc or click away closes), Issues list rows lead with the triangle. Qa scenario 9400.
- Not in this lane: Flags list grouping/filters by source, Anchor::Device/Terminal/Cable drawn on the schematic (still no drawn object), cabinet/3D surfaces (T1, T3), toasts (T7+).

## 2026-11-04 Lane T13 (commissioning)
- `novo-flags` gets `Source::Commissioning`. New `app/commissioning_flags.rs` (builder, job flags with Retry, panel strip) and `app/flag_rows.rs` (`triangle_slot`, `problem_row`). Punch, check and redline rows lead with the triangle, schematic marks come from the flags, the Defects card draws triangle rows. Census `problem_census_commissioning` = 0. Details: `t13-commissioning/`.
## 2026-11-04 Lane T12 (import, export, reports): job flags
- `app/flags_jobs.rs`: `job_fail`/`job_fail_at`/`job_ok`, `job_pill` (top bar triangle with count), popover actions Retry / Open folder / Copy details / Dismiss for `Source::Job` flags. 48 failed-job toasts in the files area now use it; census `problem_census_files` 66 to 18 (`app/problem_census_files.txt`). Lane folder `t12-files/`. QA 9522, 9523.
